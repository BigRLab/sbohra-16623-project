## Light CNN For Deep Face Representation on iOS TensorFlow

This is an iOS implementation of deep face representation using TensorFlow framework + FaceUnlock demo.

FaceUnlock demo lets you lock on to a person's face and then predict if subsequent faces are the same as the locked on face.

Face detection and alignment is done using CoreImage. Initially done using dlib, still supports doing it with dlib with
dlib flag in FaceCNNViewController.

This implementations runs at 5-6 FPS on an iPhone 6.
